What is reality and what is fiction? As for me, fiction will remain fiction until it becomes reality. 
I am a novice developer with unlimited potential. 
Many people will not understand me because of my extraordinary thinking. 
I cannot fully tell you about the project, provide drawings of the project for implementation. 
This is due to the fact that the project itself is complex and not everyone will be able to implement 
due to restrictions. My email magastrala@yandex.ru and I have indicated it for those who are interested 
in my development. Speaking briefly about my development, it is only a fiction, but only because I do
not have the resources and relevant knowledge. The project itself is a kind of mech, but with a very 
complex architecture divided into two layers, with synchronization of movements and other technologies 
for field testing. To implement the project, you will need to write the appropriate software and set up 
synchronization with the managed mechanism. But the catch is that this requires the appropriate resources
for construction. I wonder if there are people from the past hidden under a veil of illusions and if they exist, 
is it possible to find them, and also very interesting how many dormant things can be under the layer of the earth,
who knows if it could be that there are two destroyer-class spaceships underground, left in a destroyed state after 
a big battle. And what will turn out to be reality or turn out to be imagination for the plot of the game is unknown.
